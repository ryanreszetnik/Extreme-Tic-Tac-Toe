Live demo hosted on Google firebase: https://xtreme-tictactoe.web.app/

This is a website I made to play extreme tic tac toe with my friends and to keep an ongoing track of our games. The website features a sign up/sign in with email authentication, a lobby to play or spectate games, a leaderboard to rank players, and a history of your games (found under profile on user dropdown). It is still a work in progress so still many bugs so don't judge too harshly but it does enough so I can play with people. Feel free to check out the live demo and make an account and maybe play with your friends too.

The frontend is made using React (including redux, material ui, react-router etc) along with aws amplify for authentication

The backend is made for aws using node and serverless
